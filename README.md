Unscramble CLI Word Game üÖ∞Ô∏è
-------------

Guide for developers working on this codebase on how to run tests, and build an executable.


 Prerequisites
-------------
This project is written in Kotlin, so it requires the installation of the Kotlin compiler (version `1.9.21`):

- You can manually install the compiler from [Github Releases](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.9.21) 
- You can install it directly on the command line 
- On MacOS you can install the compiler via [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/):
  `brew update;
  brew install kotlin`

JUNIT5 ? - added to dependencies in gradle file


Run tests
---------
To run the tests directly in the Command Line:
- Navigate to the root directory 
- Run `./gradlew test` 


Build
-----
To get an executable (or .jar in this case)
- Navigate to the unscramble subdirectory: `cd src/main/kotlin/unscramble`
- Use this command to build the application: `kotlinc *.kt -include-runtime -d unscramble.jar` 



How to run the program
----------------------
- Navigate to the unscramble subdirectory. From the root directory:`cd src/main/kotlin/unscramble`
- Run `java -jar unscramble.jar`

How to pass arguments to the program
------------------------------------
- Once the program has been executed with `java -jar unscramble.jar` it will prompt the user to enter a guess by typing directly into the command line and pressing Enter



Usage Notes
-----------
This section list any assumptions I have made about the functionality or known limitations of the program.
 - Guess system is currently case-sensitive
 - Does not currently validate user input before submitting it as a guess, i.e. 'Are you sure x is your guess?'
 - Does not currently handle bad input to the command line args, i.e. does not check if user input is empty and likely a mistake
